# This package doesn't work perfectly well as a relocatable package, as
# libcurl is compiled as a dynamic library and the curl executable linked to
# it.  If the package is relocated out of the standard dynamic linker search
# space the curl executable may not work.  That doesn't seem like a big enough
# issue to compel me to make the package non-relocatable, but it would be nice
# to improve that user experience somehow.
